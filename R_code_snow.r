# warning message: in general these images are covering all the world, but into copernicus we are downloading just a part of the image.
#                  It says we are just using a part of the reference system, so the software cananot process the part of the image we didnt download

############## another (FAST) method to import and plot in R all the DATAS
# we are going to apply the Lapply function: returns a list of the same length as X, 
# each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.

rlist <- list.files(pattern="snow")     # pattern is the argument 
rlist   # to have the output of this function 

# now we can apply the fn Raster to all the list of these 5 files, just one time
import <- lapply(rlist, raster)

# RASTER STACK: the function stack takes different layers and put them in the same stack
snow.multitemp <- stack(import) 
snow.multitemp

# we can simply plot the snow.multitemp in just one line 
plot(snow.multitemp, col=cl)

# SUMMARY: we did the list, then we apply the raster function to every single layer(file) using lapply fn, thenk we stack on different layers all together


# LET'S SEE how to PREDICT how the state of snow will be in the future
# continuing the regression line (negative slope) we can have the next points 
# in this case we have a quite straight line, but depending on the phenomena we have different fn

#GO TO IOL and save the link prediction.r in the folder snow in lab

source("prediction.r")    #source function: it causes R to accept its input from the named file/URL/connection or expressions directly
