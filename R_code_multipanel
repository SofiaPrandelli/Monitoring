### Multipanel in R: second lecture of Monytoring ecosystems
# we'll use the install package
install.packages("sp")
install.packages("GGally") #this is used for the function ggpairs()

library(sp)    # require(sp) will also do the job
library(GGally) # used for the other packages installed 


data(meuse) #there is a dataset available named meuse
attach(meuse)

# Excercise: see the names of the variables and plot cadmium versus zinc  
# there are two ways to see the names of the variable:

# first one: 
names(meuse)

# second one: 
head(meuse)
plot(cadmium,zinc,pch=15,col="red",cex=2)

#EXCERCISE: make all the possible pairwise plots of the dataset

#plot(x,cadmium)
#plot(x,zinc)
#plot(...)
#plot is not a good idea! so we use: 

pairs(meuse)
# with the last fn, we did a MULTIPANEL, that are all the graphs in one figure 
# in case you receive the error "the size is too large", you have to reshape with the mouse the graph window

pairs(~ cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse) 

# grouping variabiles 
# ~ called tilde --> blocnum alt+126
# comma separates different arguments

pairs(meuse[,3:6])

#EXERCISE: prettify this graph 
pairs(meuse[,3:6],pch=12,col="green",cex=1.5)

#SURPRISEEE--> go up at the beginning of the code and istall another package
#GGally package will prettify the graph
#install the package and use the library(GGally)


ggpairs(meuse[,3:6]) # it's going to be a pairs but by using ggally
                     # reading of the graph: cadium and copper have very high correlation (0<correlation<1)
